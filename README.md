## ✨ About Me
> Hey there! 👋 I'm Sakshi Sharma, a curious coder 🧠 on a mission to master C++ 💻 and crack Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) 📚 — one challenge at a time.
This repository is my personal coding journal 📓 — packed with experiments 🔬, projects 🛠️, lessons learned 📖, and those exciting "aha!" moments ✨.
I believe in learning by doing 🚀, embracing mistakes 🙌, and growing with every line of code. 🌱

- 🛠️ Skills: C++ 💻 | DSA 📚 | Problem Solving 🧩 | OOP Concepts 🏛️ | Algorithms ⚙️ | Clean Code Principles 🧹
> _"Every bug 🐞 is a hidden lesson ✨."_ 

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Master core C++ concepts.
- Solve 500+ DSA problems.
- Build 10+ mini and advanced C++ projects.
- Develop a strong problem-solving mindset.

## 🛠️ How to Compile & Run

```bash
# Compile
g++ -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0600 path/to/your_file.cpp -o path/to/output.exe

# Run
./path/to/output.exe
```

> Note: For colorful, emoji-rich output, include `rang.hpp` and use `system("chcp 65001");` on Windows.
