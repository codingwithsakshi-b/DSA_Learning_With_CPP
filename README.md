## 📖 About

This repository chronicles my complete journey of mastering C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). It contains:

- Lecture code snippets and examples.
- Practice questions and solutions.
- Mini and advanced projects showcasing practical implementations.
- Personal notes, tips, and reflections in the "Vibe Corner".

I'm Sakshi Sharma, and through this repo, I aim to build, learn, and share every step of my coding adventure. 🚀

## 🛠️ How to Compile & Run

```bash
# Compile
g++ -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0600 path/to/your_file.cpp -o path/to/output.exe

# Run
./path/to/output.exe
```

> Note: For colorful, emoji-rich output, include `rang.hpp` and use `system("chcp 65001");` on Windows.
